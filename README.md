## Key Insights

- Medium and Large sizes + specific colors are most popular
- Purchase volume and average spending are relatively stable across seasons
- Discounts, promo codes, and subscription status have minimal effect on spending
- Repeat customers show slightly higher purchase frequency, especially quarterly

## Business Recommendations
- Focus marketing efforts on high-performing age groups and key states
- Prioritize inventory for top-selling categories, sizes, and colors
- Monitor seasonal trends; promotions can be tested cautiously
- Evaluate subscription programs for engagement, not spending impact
- Continue offering discounts and promo codes strategically
- 
## Limitations
Some variables, such as discounts, promo codes, and subscription status, show limited impact on purchase amount. 
This suggests that other factors not captured in the dataset may play a stronger role in driving customer spending.
